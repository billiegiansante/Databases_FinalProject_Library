This repository contains two files: DBFP_Setup_Final.sql and DBFP_Queries_Final.sql.  
The setup script creates the schema and populates it with fake data. It also creates indices, events, and triggers.  
The queries script contains examples of queries for each CRUD operation on every table. It also contains a stored procedure.
